# GETHARLEY Study Case

Guidelines

- You have 3 days from your chosen start date and time to return the task.
- You can spend as much time as you desire but we advise timeboxing it to approx. 4
  hours. We advise this as we are also interested in the trade offs you’d make based on the time constraint and the rationale behind them. Please document these in a README.md file.
- You can use any UI framework, library or tool you desire.
- It doesn’t have to be hosted in the cloud, it can be installed and run locally. Please create
  a README.md file with basic instructions to run it.
- Please share with us a link to github or gitlab with the application within the timeframe
  agreed.
